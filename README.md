# react-whiteboard

## TODO

For this project we are using the [swapi public API](https://swapi.co/).

- [ ] Modularise the existing app creating a Component for the logo
- [ ] Introduce the notion of Layout so we don't have to copy/paste the header on every page
- [ ] Update the `CharacterCard` component to make it look like the provided design
- [ ] Introduce some animation displaying the characters on the page

It should take you between 30 to 40 minutes to do so.
